description: >
  Looks for signs of attackers trying to exploit CVE-2025-0108, an auth bypass bug in
  the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS management web UI. The flaw lets unauthenticated users 
  hit specific PHP scripts without logging in which could mess with the systemâ€™s 
  integrity or leak data if successful.
